      <title>A Mnemonic for Remembering Type I vs Type II Errors</title>

      <description>Step away from inferential statistics for a while and the interpretation of Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing could slip away.
How about a mnemonic to help solidify the concepts?
To frame the mnemonic, consider the following scenario:
A man has been charged with murder and you&amp;rsquo;re on the jury. Witnesses have brought forth testimony. Evidence has been submitted. You&amp;rsquo;ve just handed in your verdict.
Now for the mnemonic:</description>

      <title>What is the tilde (~) &#34;symbol&#34; in R?</title>

      <description>What is the tilde (~) &amp;ldquo;symbol&amp;rdquo; in R?
If you were to put words to what it is, how would you explain it or interpret it?
What does it mean (and therefore, what does it do)?
Here, I document a few of the unpackings that I&amp;rsquo;ve run across when it comes to ~ in R.
From the Docs: &amp;ldquo;y on x&amp;rdquo; In the R-project.org documentation, tilde ~ starts getting mentioned in chapter 11 when the discussion of &amp;ldquo;statistical models&amp;rdquo; begins.</description>

      <description>Data is making it to the Event Hub&amp;hellip;at least you&amp;rsquo;re 99% sure it is, because successful requests are being made by your app/device and received by the Hub.
The trouble is, when you attempt to sample data with Azure Stream Analytics, you come up empty with a message like
 No events found for HubName.
 or
 Diagnostics: While sampling data, no data was received from # partitions.
 In my particular case, everything was fine with both the Event Hub and the Stream Analytics Job configurations.</description>

      <title>Deciphering U-SQL&#39;s Error Messages</title>

      <guid>https://www.dataday.life/blog/azure/deciphering-usql-error-messages/</guid>
      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s inevitable - you&amp;rsquo;re going to encounter job failures when working with Azure Data Lake Analytics U-SQL jobs.
Error Sources There are at least three root causes for a U-SQL job failure:
1) A problem with your script
2) A problem with the data
3) A problem with your extractor&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;shematizing&amp;rdquo; of your data
Deciphering Error Messages Whenever an error is reported, it can be helpful to slow down and read through the feedback that the Azure Data Lake Analytics service gave you.</description>

      <description>Newbies to U-SQL from T-SQL will soon run face-first into the wall that I ran into.
Where T-SQL isn&amp;rsquo;t picky about stuff like capitalization and terminating semicolons, U-SQL definitely is.
If you happen to fail at capitalizing one of the U-SQL keywords like SELECT or FROM, or if you miss a ; somewhere, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a syntax error:

      <description>Being able to programmatically create an HDInsight cluster, use it, and subsequently tear it down so that you don&amp;rsquo;t incur cost is one use-case for maximizing efficient use of Azure&amp;rsquo;s cloud platform.
Here, I want to break the use-case down into chunks:
Log in to Azure (PowerShell) The first step is to log in to your Azure account:

      <title>Winning with Dimensional Models in the Age of Big Data</title>
      <link>https://www.dataday.life/blog/dimensional-modeling/winning-with-dimensional-models-in-age-of-big-data/</link>

      <guid>https://www.dataday.life/blog/dimensional-modeling/winning-with-dimensional-models-in-age-of-big-data/</guid>
      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a fair question: Is dimensional modeling still relevant in the age of big data?
Read enough about &amp;ldquo;big data&amp;rdquo;, and you may start to get the impression that modeling techniques are old-fashioned or irrelevant.
Data professionals in IT departments are used to wrangling data - it&amp;rsquo;s understood that there&amp;rsquo;s no &amp;ldquo;easy button&amp;rdquo; when it comes to integrating data and geting meaning out of it. So we muster the energy and we do what it takes to get the data in order for whatever analysis the business is after.</description>

      <title>Predictive Analytics vs Machine Learning - What&#39;s the Difference?</title>
      <link>https://www.dataday.life/blog/machine-learning/predictive-analytics-vs-machine-learning-whats-the-difference/</link>

      <guid>https://www.dataday.life/blog/machine-learning/predictive-analytics-vs-machine-learning-whats-the-difference/</guid>
      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a strong temptation to equate &amp;ldquo;predictive analytics&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;machine learning&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to throw the terms around interchangeably, which signals that the two are strongly related.
BUT. Is there a difference that sometimes gets lost when we substitute one term for the other? If there is a difference, is it important to distinguish?

      <title>Fix SSIS Flat File Destination Error: Cannot open the datafile</title>
      <link>https://www.dataday.life/blog/sql-server/ssis-flat-file-destination-cannot-open-the-datafile/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.dataday.life/blog/sql-server/ssis-flat-file-destination-cannot-open-the-datafile/</guid>
      <description>This SSIS package execution error can occur for a few reasons:
 Path to the file does not exist.  So for example, if you&amp;rsquo;re writing the file to C:\Some\Folder\somefile.txt, C:\Some\Folder needs to exist first.
Fix: Create the folder that the package will write to prior to executing it.
Alternatively, you can add a File System Task with a Create Directory operation prior to the Flat File Destination component.
 The account executing the package does not have permissions  Check to make sure whichever account is executing the package has sufficient file system permissions to write the file to disk.</description>

      <description>Nothing I publish is perfect.
Everything I publish is a &amp;ldquo;work in progress&amp;rdquo; to some degree or another.
I once wrote about Agile Blogging. My thought was, &amp;ldquo;What if I could incrementally build up content, rather than have to sit down and write until all my thoughts were fully fleshed out and &amp;lsquo;perfect&amp;rsquo;? What would that look like?&amp;rdquo;
I took some cues from the Agile software development methodology, and decided that I&amp;rsquo;d value continual enhancement and gradual build-up of my content, over and above long time commitments and perfection.</description>

      <guid>https://www.dataday.life/blog/general-data-concepts/data-analysis-vs-data-analytics-examining-suffix/</guid>
      <description>&amp;ldquo;Analysis&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;analytics&amp;rdquo; are extremely similar words&amp;hellip; I mean, just the word-ending is different: &amp;ldquo;-sis&amp;rdquo; vs &amp;ldquo;-tics&amp;rdquo;
Since the end of the words is where the difference lies (otherwise, there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be two of them, right?), why not go find out what each suffix might indicate to get some clues as to what the difference between the words are?
I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with &amp;ldquo;analysis&amp;rdquo;.
Then I&amp;rsquo;m going to move to &amp;ldquo;analytic&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Where is the SQL Server 2017 Reporting Services License Key??</title>

      <description>SQL Server 2017 Reporting Services is no longer bundled with the main SQL Server installer, so if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to add the Reporting Services 2017 feature, you need to run the stand-alone installer.
When you run said installer, you&amp;rsquo;ll be presented with a dialog asking for a product key.
But uhhhh&amp;hellip; Where is it?
Naturally, we went to our Volume Licensing Portal, but Reporting Services 2017 isn&amp;rsquo;t listed.
Additionally, we looked for a SQL Server 2017 key, but the portal indicated that our copy of SQL Server &amp;ldquo;didn&amp;rsquo;t require&amp;rdquo; a product key.</description>

But before you can get answers, you need to do a certain kind of analysis.
But before you do analysis, you need data to perform the analysis on.
But before you bother with data, you typically have one or more questions in mind.</description>

When you boil data down to the essentials, what you get are&amp;hellip;
 Measurement(s) Descriptions of the measurement(s)  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what industry you&amp;rsquo;re in. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter the process that captured the data you&amp;rsquo;re looking at. At the end of the day, you&amp;rsquo;ve got numbers and classifications as measurements, and you&amp;rsquo;ve got the context describing the who, what, when, where, why, and how of those measurements.</description>

So how do you know if someone is asking a question that&amp;rsquo;s a good fit for using predictive analytics to provide the answer?
Patterns and Key Words From a recent read through Predictive Analytics, I jotted down a few patterns that emerged as each application of predictive analytics was presented.</description>
