    <div class="content">

    <p>There&rsquo;s a strong temptation to equate &ldquo;predictive analytics&rdquo; and &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not uncommon to throw the terms around interchangeably, which signals that the two are strongly related.</p>
<p>BUT. Is there a <em>difference</em> that sometimes gets lost when we substitute one term for the other? If there <em>is</em> a difference, is it important to distinguish?</p>
<h2 id="predictive-analytics-a-method-for-analysis">Predictive Analytics: A Method for Analysis</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.dataday.life/data-analysis-vs-data-analytics-examining-suffix/">Breaking Down Data Analysis vs Data Analytics: A Look at the Suffix</a>, I reasoned that analytics essentially &ldquo;denotes the body of facts… the knowledge about… the principles for: analysis. Analytics is about methodology. It’s about the approach to performing analysis. It’s the <em>science</em> of analysis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.dataday.life/what-types-of-data-analysis-are-there/">What Types of Data Analysis Are There?</a>, I noted that predictive <em>analysis</em> is what you&rsquo;re doing when you analyze data in a way that can produce predictions of measurements for specific &ldquo;units&rdquo; within a population (as opposed to inferential analysis where the measurement predictions are made for the population as a whole).</p>
<p>Combining the two concepts of &ldquo;analytics&rdquo; and &ldquo;predictive analysis&rdquo; ought to lend us to a natural definition for &ldquo;predictive analytics&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Predictive analytics refers to the principles and methods for making measurement predictions for specific &ldquo;units&rdquo; within a population.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Predictive analytics is concerned with the principles and methods for, say&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking an individual customer from the population of a company&rsquo;s customer base, analyzing data about him/her, and predicting the liklihood that he/she will purchase [this product] if we run [this marketing campaign] targeted at them</li>
<li>Taking a single house from the population of homes in a city or neighborhood, and predicting the selling price</li>
</ul>
<p>Predictive analytics encapsulates the principles and methods for computing estimations for these measurements (or any number of others that <a href="https://www.dataday.life/patterns-and-key-words-of-predictive-analytics-questions/">fit the pattern of questions</a> for predictive analytics to provide the answer for).</p>
<p>The thing about &ldquo;predictive analytics&rdquo; as a term, is that it&rsquo;s pretty abstract.  Notably missing in these &ldquo;principles and methods&rdquo; is the <strong>how to do it</strong>.</p>
<p><em>That</em> is what &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo; is.</p>
<h2 id="machine-learning--a-way-to-do-predictive-analytics">Machine Learning:  A Way to do Predictive Analytics</h2>
<p>Machine learning is a way to <em>do</em> predictive analytics.</p>
<p>It is one way to take this idea of predicting measurements for an &ldquo;individual unit&rdquo; within a population, and turn it into a reality.</p>
<p><em>One</em> way?  So&hellip; there are <em>other ways</em> to do predictive analytics??</p>
<p>I can think of at least one&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="before-there-were-machines-to-learn">Before There Were Machines to Learn</h2>
<p>Before there were machines, there were&hellip; <em>people</em>.</p>
<p>People (statisticians in particular) have been doing predictive analysis for decades, if not centuries. It may have taken longer and been more tedius and error-prone, but steps that are taken to figure out &ldquo;the answer&rdquo; in machine learning have been do-able by humans for a long time&hellip; they are not &ldquo;new&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sooooo&hellip; why &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo;?</p>
<p>In short, it&rsquo;s a <em>scale</em> problem with modern data sets. The data sets of the 21st century are much larger than ever before in history.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s <em>possible</em> for people to compute the outputs that a machine learning algorithm can produce, it&rsquo;s <em>unnecessary</em>.  Due to the scale of data in today&rsquo;s world, it&rsquo;s also insanely impractical for many data sets.</p>
<h2 id="automating-the-humans-steps">Automating the Human&rsquo;s Steps</h2>
<p>If you handed me a small data set and said, &ldquo;Manually find a way to produce a predicted house price for a home in [this neighborhood]&rdquo;, I could probably swing it.</p>
<p>If you handed me another similar data set and asked me to do the same thing, I could probably do it again, assuming I remember all the steps.  On the second round, I might even be brilliant enough to <em>write the steps down</em>.</p>
<p>If you came to me again (and again, and again), I could follow the steps one by one to produce predictions.  I&rsquo;d just be really tired, bored, and annoyed.</p>
<p>Naturally, you might ask, &ldquo;Why not <em>automate the steps</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the idea behind machine learning!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Machine learning&rdquo; simply describes what computers do when they execute <em>programs</em> to produce predictions.</p>
<p>Computer scientists take the specific steps that need to be followed in order to produce a prediction (an <em>algorithm</em>, if you will) and <em>write code</em> to let a computer (a <em>machine</em>) do those steps and produce the prediction.</p>
<p>Same results.  Without goof-ups.  Faster.</p>
<p>Happier Andrew.</p>
<p>That is machine learning&hellip; it involves the encoding of the steps that need to be taken in order to produce measurement predictions of all kinds in such a way that a computer can <em>execute</em> those steps and produce the result we want.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom-Line</h2>
<p>Predictive analytics and machine learning are not &ldquo;the same&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Predictive analytics is about [the way(s)], in general, to make estimations about specific people (or specific animals or widgets or [whatever] the &ldquo;unit&rdquo; of interest is from your population of &ldquo;units&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Machine learning <em>is</em> one of those ways to make those predictions a reality.</p>
<p>The means to do something&hellip;the methods and strategies and ways we approach accomplishing a goal&hellip;are not the same thing as the goal itself. They&rsquo;re two distinct things, aren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>If I say, &ldquo;My goal is to save $1000 by Christmas.&rdquo;, I could go about achieving that goal in a dozen ways.  I might begin a saving strategy that involves setting back about $83 / month, the goal and the strategy are two separate things.  I might take on a side project to earn extra money, or sell stuff on Craigslist. In either case, the strategy <em>accomplishes</em> the goal.</p>
<p>Predictive analytics is the goal.  Machine learning is a strategy used to <em>accomplish</em> the goal.</p>
<h2 id="theyre-different----so-what">They&rsquo;re Different &ndash; So What?</h2>
<p>So who cares if they&rsquo;re different?  Is it even an important distinction to make?  What&rsquo;s the harm in swapping in &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo; for &ldquo;predictive analytics&rdquo;, or vice-versa?</p>
<p>One could make the argument that it only matters if you&rsquo;re OCD about terms.  My take on it is that &ldquo;data science&rdquo; is already this nebulous, vague, muddy-water field, so any effort we can make to be precise about our terms can help clarify what we mean is helpful.</p>
<p>Is it <em>harmful</em> to equate predictive analytics and machine learning? I suppose that depends on your view of how important it is to be clear and precise so as not to cause confusion.</p>
<p>Having to Google &ldquo;Predictive analytics vs machine learning&rdquo; is one clue that the water is already muddy enough.  Life and death may not be at stake, but I think it&rsquo;s <em>helpful</em> to develop the right mental model for all of these pieces to fit together in the world of data science.</p>
