Not all questions are "predictive analytics questions".  That is to say, not every question you receive as a data science practitioner requires predictive analytics to answer.

So how do you know if someone is asking a question that's a good fit for using predictive analytics to provide the answer?

# Patterns and Key Words
From a recent read through [Predictive Analytics](https://www.amazon.com/Predictive-Analytics-Power-Predict-Click-ebook/dp/B019HR9X4U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1513540111&sr=8-1&keywords=predictive+analytics), I jotted down a few patterns that emerged as each application of predictive analytics was presented.  Apendix B in the book is an excellent summary of twenty predictive analytics applications across different industries.

First, let's take a look at a few examples of predictive questions.  Then let's see if we can find the pattern or identify some key words.

* "Which customers will respond to marketing contact?"
* "Which ad is a customer most likely to click?"
* "Which employees will quit?"

When you hear people asking questions like, "Which [customer/ad/employees] will [respond/click/quit]", it should trigger "predictive analytics" in your mind as a reasonable way to approach getting the answer to the question.

## Key words to listen for are:
* **Which [noun]** -- The questioner is wanting to narrow things down to a particular set... "nouns of interest", if you will.
* **<em>Will</em>** -- There's a future-focus to the question.
* **Likely** -- When probability enters the vocabulary of the question, there's a chance that predictive analytics can help with the answer.
* **[Take action]** -- Fill in [take action] with just about any verb of importance.  When you hear someone asking whether someone/something will respond, or click, or quit, or [you name it], predictive analytics could be a tool that helps shed some light on the answer.

Here are a few more:
* "Is this e-mail spam or not?"
* "Will the stock go up or down?"
* "Will the player win or lose?"

## Key words to listen for are:
* **"___ or ___"** -- in each of the questions, the answer is in one of a few *categories*:  [is/is not], [up/down], [win/lose].  There need not be only two categories. The point is that any time the questioner is attempting ot figure out whether [something] fits in one category or another, predictive analytics could lend a hand in sorting things out.
* **[final outcome]** -- Many times, questioners are wanting to know the probable final outcome of some event that hasn't occurred yet.  When that's the case, let predictive analytics be a tool you use for giving insight into the answer.
